# Auto_battler

Python game project for a single-player auto battler (Version 1.3.1).

This game is a hobby project aimed at learning Python and various libraries, such as SQLite, NumPy, 
and Pandas, which are used extensively throughout the codebase. It includes a built-in simulator for 
capturing gameplay data. The collected data is then used to analyze and refine game balance, 
enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

## Requirements
* Python 3.9 or 3.10
* pygame 2.1.2
* numpy 1.23.4
* pandas 2.0.0

Please note: While the game may run on Python 3.11 or higher, using Python 3.9 or 3.10 is recommended.

### Optional Dependencies
* matplotlib 3.7.1
* scikit_learn 1.2.2

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Junkkah/auto_battler.git
cd auto_battler
pip install .
python main.py
```

## Troubleshooting: Sound Issues with Pygame 2.3.0
* Symptoms: Sounds may not play properly or may exhibit unexpected behavior.
* Resolution: To ensure proper sound functionality, it is recommended to use Pygame version 2.1.2.

## Future Updates

### Planned Update to Pygame 2.5.0
In future releases, an update for the game to utilize Pygame version 2.5.0 is planned.
