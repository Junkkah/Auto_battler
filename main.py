Main Game Script

This script serves as the entry point for the game and operates the main game loop,
state management, and screen rendering.

Usage:
    Run this script to start the game. The game initializes various game states such as
    the menu, shop, world map, battle, and others, and transitions between them based on
    user input and game events.

Attributes:
    size (tuple): The size of the game window in pixels (width, height).
    fps (int): The target frames per second for the game.

Classes:
    Control: A class representing the main game controller. It manages the game loop,
    state transitions, and screen rendering.

Methods:
    setup_states(state_dict, start_state): Initialize the game states with the provided
    dictionary mapping state names to state objects. Set the initial game state.
    flip_state(): Transition to the next game state based on the current state's 'next'
    attribute. Cleanup the current state and initialize the new state.
    update(dt): Update the game state and perform any necessary state transitions based
    on user input and game events.
    event_loop(): Handle user input events such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
    main_game_loop(): Start the main game loop, continuously updating and rendering the
    game until the user exits or the game is terminated.

Usage Example:
    Run the script with the appropriate Python interpreter to start the game:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```
